# <a name="hello">hello</a>.

Welcome to this, the first edition of "Down the Rabbit-Hole"! 
What you'll find here are links to things I've found interesting since the previous issue 
(in this case over the last week), but more than that - I also intend to provide with each link
a list of background reading, occasionally relevant supporting information and probably
the odd opinion or two. 

The current mentality of quick fix, [dopaminergic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopaminergic) link browsing where we're 
rapidly context switching is like feeding your brain junk food. I want to provide something with more substance. 

The title is an allusion to the kind of wiki-trailing I can often find
myself absorbed in. This is in part an attempt to document that process.

I don't have a commenting system set up yet, but if you want to share something with me you can find me 
on twitter at [@jdpearce](http://twitter.com/jdpearce).

And look...someone other than [Terry Davis](https://www.reddit.com/user/TempleOS_Terry_Davis) has written an application for it :

### javascript.
I've been doing a lot of Javascript development recently and it's been fun, but exasperating. Javascript and web development still feels like a
wild frontier where things are changing so fast that it's difficult to keep up.

It's great to have a [lingua franca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingua_franca) for the web but why oh why did it have to be a language that
was [written in 10 days](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich#Netscape_and_JavaScript) and hardly seems to have evolved since
, although the ecosystem based on it certainly has.

### microservices.
http://martinfowler.com/microservices/

I know microservices are rather the darling of the moment in enterprise application architecture, but I honestly think they're overblown. 
That's not to say that I think they're without merit, I just think they'll end up being one of a range of design patterns in the software architect's toolkit.

There's an intriguing back and forth over the implementation of microservices between [Martin Fowler](http://martinfowler.com/) and [Stefan Tilkov](https://www.innoq.com/blog/st/), 
both highly regarded individuals in enterprise development.

Martin Fowler : http://martinfowler.com/bliki/MonolithFirst.html

Stefan Tilkov replies : http://martinfowler.com/articles/dont-start-monolith.html

I disagree with Stefan on a number of points, mainly because I don't believe that your goal could ever be as specific as a microservices architecture unless
you're redeveloping an existing system and the idea that you can know the context boundaries before you've developed a system once seems naively optimistic.
 Martin is somewhat more circumspect and less evangelistic, which is an attitude I find myself adopting much of the time. 
I have to admit to being generally quite sceptical of anyone who tries to peddle an architecture as some kind of [silver bullet solution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet).
